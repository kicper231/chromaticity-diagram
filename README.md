# Chromaticity Diagram Visualizer

## Overview
This WinForms application enables the visualization of chromatic coordinates (x, y) for a variety of wavelengths, displayed along the colorful boundary of a horseshoe-shaped chromaticity diagram. It supports interactive plotting of spectral distributions using Bezier curves, allowing for real-time updates of chromatic coordinates on the diagram.

## Features
1. **Colorful Chromaticity Boundary**: Renders the boundary of the chromaticity diagram with a spectrum of colors representing individual wavelengths.
2. **Horseshoe Diagram Background**: Integrates a horseshoe diagram sourced from the web as the backdrop for the visualization.
3. **Dynamic Spectral Distribution Plotting**: Allows for the drawing of any spectral distribution curve with Bezier curves of any degree, automatically updating and showcasing chromatic coordinates (x, y) on the diagram.

## Data Source
Chromatic coordinates (x, y, z) for different wavelengths can be acquired from the CIE 1931 XYZ color space chart.
